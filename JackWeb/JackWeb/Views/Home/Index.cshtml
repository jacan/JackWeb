        <h5>My little playground</h5>
        <p>Hello, my name is Jack Andersen, and I'm a passionate software developer working with bleeding edge
        developmen tools, languages, idioms and paradigmes.
        <br />
        <br />
        This is my playground - a place to experiment.
        <br />
        <br />
        As you (for the initiated) I'm using the standard MVC4 template. I'm no designer, so my website here
        is simple, yet good looking though.
        Some of my new experiences with the newest withing bleeding edge development will be posted in here, as
        some sort of article/whitepaper or abstract.
        <br />
        <br />
        So get ready - and remember that developing software is about fun, creativity, a little discipline and offcourse
        being agile.. Let the playing being.
